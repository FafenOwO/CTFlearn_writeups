Here is a pic of my friend Bobby Toe. while he's happy to give you his iPad, he's not as willing to give you the flag. 
can you get it from him? here is an image of Bobby Toe:

Tools used: strings, hexed.it (hex editor), binwalk, Aperi'Solve, http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/otp.php (One Time Pad decryption tool)

Checking the file attacked with

# strings -10 bobbytoesipad.png

...we can see a string: "congrats you found me! you win an iPad!"
Binwalk doesn't return anything valuable at this point, but if we open the file in a hex editor, we can clearly see a JFIF header.
If we get rid of that string (which happens to be right before the header), binwalk starts to see the file.
Now, it is possible to extract using

binwalk -D=".*" bobbytoesipad-edited.png

The image extracted contains a caption: bbbabydonthurtmewhatislove
After checking, we know it isn't the flag we are looking for. But having a look at this challenge's name, it is very likely to use one time pad encryption.

Both strings and binwalk are useless when it comes to the second image. 

Checking our first file with Aperi'Solve, we see a caption above the character's head: zpv_tigqylhbafmeoesllpms.

Length doesn't match and the second string contains an underscore character, but one time pad's still may be worth cheching.
CyberChef and boxentriq's tools don't return anything interesting (that works), but rumkin's decryption tool gives the flag:
