I sent a couple of images to my friend, Leslie S. Brown, to edit. 
The only problem is that she only sent back 1 image! 
Can you help me figure out what happened to the other image? 
Also, for whatever reason, the image has a red tinge to it.

Tools used: zsteg

We get a file named final.png. "Red tinge" may suggest that the author used steganography to hide a message.
To check, let's use zsteg.

# zsteg -a final.png 

Second line of the output suggests that there is a PNG image at b1,r,lsb,xy.
We create an empty png file and redirect the output of the extract option there.

# touch answer.png
# zsteg -E b1,r,lsb,xy final.png > answer.png

Opening the second file, we immediately notice weird colors on the top of it. Could the same tool work?

# zsteg -a answer.png

We notice a suspiciously looking piece of text. 
b1,r,lsb,xy         .. text: "1_kn3W_tH3_r3D_w4s_0ff"
That is our flag!
