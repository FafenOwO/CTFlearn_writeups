Have you met my friend John?

He's not so scary, even though they call him "The Ripper".

Tools: fcrackzip, rock-you.txt

The challenge has a .zip file attached. Inside, we find the interesting password-protected part. It's very likely to be cracked using John the Reaper tool.
My personal preference is fcrackzip (just simplier for such files), so let's try that first.

Bruteforcing the file the usual way seems to take ages. Thus, attacking it with a wordlist may be worth trying.

# fcrackzip -v -u -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt use-rockyou.zip

It quickly outputs the password: kdbs0429
Using a GUI archive manager (laziness isn't always bad), we extract the file just to find another password-protected .zip and what seems to be a custom wordlist.
Repeating the previous command with it may work.

# fcrackzip -v -u -D -p custom-list.txt custom-list.zip

Just like before, password is found really quick: 1N73rD3N0M1N4710N41
And guess what, another .zip file inside.
Custom wordlist doesn't help, but one we used earlier returns the password in a few second

# fcrackzip -v -u -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt brute-force-pin.zip

991337
This .zip included only a text file with out flag.

# cat flag.txt

shows CTFlearn{s0_n0W_y0uv3_M3t_J0hN}


----------------
In Kali Linux, the rockyou.txt wordlist is usually already placed in /usr/share/wordlists.
If you haven't used it before, go there and extract it. Gunzip should do.
----------------
Options used for fcrackzip are:
-v  | verbose
-u  | use unzip, gets rid of false possibilities
-D  | dictionary attack
-p  | init password string, to select the wordlist
