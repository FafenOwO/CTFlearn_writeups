Skynet is using a very small list of primes for RSA style encryption purposes. 
In fact their list is only the size of the smallest odd prime. 
One of the robots sent a message to three other robots. 
These are futuristic robots with the ability to use quantum computing and so they don't mind prime factoring huge numbers.
You can't do that though. Find out what message the robot sent to his friends. 
Flag is in flag{} format.

As the description states, factoring is not the intended way to solve this challenge.
But if we use tools (which is pretty tempting), the first n value turns out to be small enough.
To make the command more readable, numbers were replaced with tags.

# python3 RsaCtfTool.py --uncipher < c1 >  -n < n1 > --attack factordb -e < e >

The flag should be in the output:
utf-8 : flag{will_he_be_back}

The way it was meant to be solved is very likely to be CRT.
